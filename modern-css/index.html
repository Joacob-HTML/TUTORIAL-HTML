        There are currently <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-math-functions">four
        well-supported math functions in CSS.</a> I've found each of them to be
        extremely useful in my daily work. These CSS functions can be used in 
        perhaps unexpected ways, such as within gradients and color functions
        and in combination with CSS custom properties. We'll learn the syntax
        for each, view basic demos of their functionality, and explore practical use cases.

    <h2 id="calc">
       <code>calc()</code>
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Practical purpose of <code>calc()</code></strong>: performing 
            basic math operations, with the ability to interpolate between unit 
            types (ex. <code>rem</code> to <code>vw</code>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This math function has the longest cross-browser support of the four functions
        we're exploring. It has a wide range of uses for any time you'd like to be
        able to do client-side math within your styles.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you may want something to take up most of the viewport height except
        the height of the navigation. For this purpose, you can mix units to pass a relative
        <code>vh</code> (view height) unit with an absolute pixel unit:
    </p>
    <pre><code>.content {
    height: calc(100vh - 60px);
}</code></pre>
    <p>
        As the viewport resizes or a user visits on larger or
        smaller devices, the value of <code>100vh</code> will dynamically
        update, and therefore so will the calculation.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The benefit of <code>calc()</code> is in allowing you to avoid
            either hard-coding a range of magic numbers or
            adding a JavaScript solution to calculate the
            value needed to apply it as an inline style.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Using <code>calc()</code> For Generative Color Palettes</h3>
    <p>
        We can extend the capabilities of calc() 
        by passing in CSS custom properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of this being very useful is creating
        a consistent color palette using <code>hsl()</code> 
        (which stands for hue, saturation, and lightness).
        Given values for saturation, lightness,
        and a starting hue, we can calculate complementary
        values to build a full palette. 
        Because of the commonality among the saturation
        and lightness values, the palette will feel
        cohesive.

<h2><code>clamp()</code></h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Practical purpose of</strong>
            <code>clamp()</code>: setting boundaries
            on a range of acceptable values. 
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The <code>clamp()</code> function takes three values,
        and order matters. The first is the lowest
        value in your range, the middle is your
        ideal value, and the third is the highest
        value in your range. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An area you may have already encountered the use
        of <code>clamp()</code> is for fluid typography. 
        The essential concept is that the <code>font-size</code> 
        value can fluidly adjust based on the viewport size.
        This is intended to prevent large headlines triggering
        overflow, or taking up too much of the viewport.  
    </p>
    <p>
        A very basic definition for a fluid <code>h1</code> style:
    </p>
    <pre>
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.75rem, 4vw + 1rem, 3rem);
}</pre>
    <p>
        You can <a href=

        read more about generating fluid type in the Modern
        CSS episode 12.</a> 
    </p>
    <h3>Relative Responsive Padding With <code>clamp()</code></h3>
    <p>
        Another example can be seen in <a href="https://smolcss.dev/#smol-responsive-padding">
        my demo from SmolCSS on responsive padding</a>. 
        The interesting thing about
        using percentages for padding is that it is relative
        to the element's width. This means it's a bit like
        a container-relative unit, which we can use similar
        to how you might think of <code>vw</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The example from SmolCSS uses the following padding
        definition, where the padding will grow and shrink
        relative to the element's width. It will never be
        less than 1rem, and never greater than <code>3rem</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
.element {
  padding: 1.5rem clamp(1rem, 5%, 3rem);
}
</pre>
    <p>
        You may have realized this again removes some
        scenarios where you might have previously reached
        for media queries. Instead of micro-managing this
        spacing or worrying about strictly adhering to a
        pixel ramp (ex 8, 12, 24, 36), you can set up
        sensible guidelines for a responsive transition.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The most significant benefit here versus media
        queries is that since this padding definition
        is element relative, it will be larger when
        the element has more space on the page and
        smaller if, for example, it's placed in a narrow
        column. This would take a lot of coordination
        with media-query-based utility classes!
    </p>
    <h2><code>min()</code></h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Practical purpose of 
            <code>min()</code></strong>: setting boundaries on the
            maximum allowed value in a way that encompasses
            the responsive context of an element.
        </blockquote>
    <p>
        That's right - despite being the <code>min()</code> function,
        the outcome is that the provided values will
        act as a maximum allowed value for the property. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Given <code>width: min(80ch, 100vw)</code>, the outcome is that
        on a larger viewport, the <code>80ch</code> will be selected
        because it is the smaller value of the two options,
        yet it <em>acts like</em> a maximum based on contextually
        available space. Once the viewport shrinks, 
        <code>100vw</code> will be used because it is computed as <em>smaller
        than</em> <code>80ch</code>, yet it's actually providing a maximum
        boundary for the element's width.
    </p>
    <h3>The Modern CSS <code>.container</code> Class</h3>
    <p>
        The example just provided is my preferred way
        to define a <code>.container</code>, with one tiny tweak.
        The <code>min()</code> function allows nested basic math
        operations, which means we can flip to subtracting
        some space as a swap for defining left and
        right padding, as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
.container {
  width: min(80ch, 100vw - 2rem);
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        On larger viewports, the element can grow to
        a <em>max</em> of <em>80ch</em>, and once the viewport shrinks
        below that width, it will be allowed to grow
        to <code>100vw - 2rem</code>. This definition effectively
        produces <code>1rem</code> of "padding" on either
        side of the element. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, you could also swap to <code>100%</code>
        instead of vw to make the element width 
        responsive within a <em>parent container</em>, 
        as used for this demo:

            properties at the time it is applied.

            line length for a better reading experience, for example.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>What's the benefit</strong>? 
        Responsive sizing without
        the need for media queries! It seems to be
        a common theme for these functions 😉
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>min()</code> function is my most used of the math functions.
        Let's look at some more amazing upgrades
        to practical scenarios.
    </p>
    <h3>Responsive Element Sizing with <code>min()</code></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Any time you would like to size an element responsively,</strong>
        <strong><code>min()</code> can be a great choice</strong>.
        For example, I explored <a href="">using
        <code>min()</code> to control sizing an avatar</a>  within a comment thread
        in Modern CSS episode 26.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the avatar example, we ended up applying
        <em>three</em> values with different units: 
        <code>min(64px, 15%, 10vw)</code>.
        Another way to read this is that the avatar
        size will not exceed one of those values at
        any given time, with the browser selecting
        whichever is the <em>minimum</em> computed value.
    </p>
    <p>
        This definition works out to never having an
        avatar larger than <code>64px</code>. Particularly in a
        zoom scenario, the <code>10vw</code> helps the size feel
        more relative. 
        And the <code>15%</code> helps keep the size relative to the
        element, which may have a more visually appealing
        result before the <code>10vw</code> applies.

                Sign Up
            </button>
        </div>
    </form>
<h3>Using <code>min()</code> Within Other Properties</h3>
    <p>
        CSS math functions can be used in most properties
        that allow a numeric value. One unique place to
        use them is within <code>background-size</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why? Perhaps you're supplying a layered effect of
        a background color and an image. And rather than
        using the <code>cover</code> size value, which would make the
        image fill the space, you would like to cap the
        growth of the image. This is a perfect place to
        bring in <code>min()</code>.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the following example, where <code>min()</code> is used
        to ensure the image doesn't exceed <code>600px</code> while being
        allowed to respond down with the element by also
        setting <code>100%</code>. In other words, it will
        grow <em>up to</em> <code>600px</code>
        and then resize itself down to match the element's
        width when it is less than <code>600px</code>.

    <h2><code>max()</code></h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>Practical purpose of <code>max()</code></strong>: setting boundaries
                on the minimum allowed value in a way that
                encompasses the responsive context of an element. 
            </p>
        </blockquote>
    <p>
        Yup, <code>max()</code> is the opposite of <code>max()</code>! So now we are
        setting up definitions for the <em>minimum</em> allowed values. 
        Let's get right to the examples!
    </p>
    <h3>Contextual Margins with <code>max()</code></h3>
    <p>
        After learning about the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html">
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Success Criterion 1.4.10</a> 
        for reflow, which states that a user should be able to use zoom 
        to magnify your site to 400%, I noticed that pixels 
        and rems become a subpar unit in that context.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given a desktop size of 1280px at 400% zoom, 
        your content is equivalent to a device at 320px. 
        However - versus a mobile phone - the orientation 
        is still landscape. A viewport of this size means 
        a much-reduced area to read and perform actions. 
        Additionally, sizes that seemed appropriate for a 
        phone become a lot large contextually when viewed 
        in a zoomed-in window.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, <code>max()</code> gives us one way 
        to in particular handle margins more gracefully. 
        I avoid pixel values for everything in my personal work 
        and usually prefer rem for smaller spaces. 
        But for larger spaces intended to separate content 
        sections, I use the following, which allows relative
        growth for tall viewports and reduces distance for 
        shorter viewports, which also applies to zoomed viewports.
    </p>
    <pre>
.element + .element {
  margin-top: max(8vh, 2rem);
}   
    </pre>
    <p> On the taller viewports, 8vh will be used, and on 
        smaller or zoomed-in viewports, 2rem will be used. 
        I encourage you to try this out and spend some 
        time testing across viewports, devices, and with
        and without zooming into your layout. 
        This technique is a small upgrade that can make
        a significant difference for the end-user.

    <h3>Prevent Browser Zoom on Inputs in iOS with <code>max()</code></h3>
    <p>
        Have you ever experienced forced browser zoom
        once you focused a form input on iOS? 
        This consequence will happen for any input 
        that has a font-size less than <code>16px</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's the fix, originally linked in <a href="https://moderncss.dev/custom-css-styles-for-form-inputs-and-textareas/">Modern 
        CSS episode 21 about custom form input styles</a>, 
        with full credit to <a href="https://dev.to/danburzo/css-micro-tip-make-mobile-safari-not-have-to-zoom-into-inputs-1fc1">
        Dan Burzo</a> for this simple solution:
    </p>
    <pre>
input {
  font-size: max(16px, 1rem);
}
    </pre>
    <p>Where <code>1rem</code> could be swapped with a Sass variable 
        or a CSS custom property. This use of <code>max()</code> 
        ensures that regardless of another value provided, 
        the <code>font-size</code> will be <em>at least</em> 
        <code>16px</code> and therefore prevent the 
        forced browser zoom.
    </p>
    <h3>Relative Focus Outlines with <code>max()</code></h3>
    <p>
        The latest addition to my CSS reset uses 
        <code>min()</code> to apply relative sizing 
        for focus outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a reduced snippet, but by using <code>max()</code>, 
        we ensure a <em>minimum</em> outline size of <code>2px</code>, while 
        allowing it to <em>grow</em> relative to the element by 
        using the font-relative <code>em</code> value.
    </p>
    <pre>
a {
  --outline-size: max(2px, 0.08em);
  --outline-style: solid;
  --outline-color: currentColor;
}

a:focus {
  outline: var(--outline-size) var(--outline-style) var(--outline-color);
  outline-offset: var(--outline-size);
}
    </pre>
    <h3>Accessible Target Sizes with <code>max()</code></h3>
    <p>
        The term "target size" comes from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-enhanced.html">
        WCAG Success Criterion (SC) 2.5.5</a>, where "target" 
        refers to the area that will receive a pointer event 
        (ex. mouse click or touch tap). In the upcoming 
        WCAG 2.2, SC 2.5.5 is now the "Enhanced" version, 
        which has a minimum size of <code>44px</code>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this guideline, consider buttons that only use icons 
        or the avatar from our earlier example that links to a 
        profile. Or perhaps a dual-action button where a dropdown
        arrow is a separate action from the primary button 
        control.
    </p>
    <p>
        In these instances, we can use <code>max()</code> similarly to 
        when we provided a guardrail to prevent the input 
        zooming. We'll set <code>44px</code> as one of the values within 
        <code>max()</code> so that at <em>minimum</em>, that is the element's size.
    </p>
        <pre>
.icon-button {
  width: max(44px, 2em);
  height: max(44px, 2em);
}            
        </pre>
    <p>
        It should be noted that this criterion also considers 
        the space around the element, which if combined with 
        the element's actual size is <em>at least</em> 
        <code>44px</code>, then the criterion is passed 
        successfully. As with all of these techniques, 
        be sure to test with your actual product and 
        with real users!

    <h3>Using <code>max()</code> As A Fallback for CSS <code>aspect-ratio</code></h3>
    <p>
        Another way I've used <code>max()</code> is to set an image height 
        when using <code>aspect-ratio</code> to enable an acceptable 
        experience for browsers that do not yet support that 
        property.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see the following sample fully in use for 
        the <a href="https://smolcss.dev/#smol-card-component">
        SmolCSS demo for a composable card component</a>.
    </p>
        <pre>
img {
  /* Fallback for `aspect-ratio` of defining a height */
  height: max(18vh, 12rem);
  object-fit: cover;
  width: 100%;
}
              
/* When supported, use `aspect-ratio` */
@supports (aspect-ratio: 1) {
  img {
    aspect-ratio: var(--img-ratio);
    height: auto;
  }
}  
        </pre>
    <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
    <p>
        This final demo shows an example of applying multiple 
        CSS math functions to allow responsive sizing across 
        several properties. Note the comments alongside the 
        demonstrated code.
